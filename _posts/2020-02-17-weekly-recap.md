## What Worked Well?

I told myself I was going to grind this week, and I definitely started that way.
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday I wrote an immense amount of code, which I think
is pretty well reflected in the 3400 lines of code changed this week. I bought a
new keyboard since my old one was wearing out, which was a welcome improvement
to the work environment. After Wednesday, I actually implemented the thing I had
hoped to build for over 3 years. Discussions and detailed plans helped make that
happen. I also really enjoyed my routine of no phone for the first 15 minutes in
the morning, and reading a Medium article over breakfast before starting the workday.

I also really enjoyed collaborating this week. I spoke up during a discussion about
a lab mates rebuttal and offered an idea. At first I was stressed -- I had my
own stuff to do that I was struggling with -- but, in reality I enjoyed sitting
with him in the lab and working out the solutions together. Definitely enjoyable.

## What Needs Improvement?

I still didn't develop a true time table for exactly what needs to happen when,
so that's an obvious setback. I think the really struggle this week though, was
simpler than that. I have wanted to integrate reinforcement learning (the real
state-of-the-art type algorithms) into my research for the better part of my PhD,
and on Wednsday I finally did that. I think the hardest part was that no one 
noticed, cared, or even asked about it. I'm well aware I'm not as self-motivated
as I should be, but, that somehow felt like a major accomplishment. I need to
find a way to bounce back faster. 

We've been trying to implement daily stand-ups in our lab, you know, Scrum style.
Unfortunately, rarely is everyone (or anyone?) in attendance besides myself and Mesyam.
A scrum with just two people doesn't quite play well when you're working on two
very different things. So clearly that's not the answer either.

Perhaps worst of all, this weekend I failed in my monthly goal -- no phone for
the first 15 minutes of the day now 3 times. This was mostly a result of the weekend,
I wanted to sleep in, and more importantly, so did Lyndsey. I think it's already
hard to leave a comfy bed, but it's harder when your partner doesn't want you to
leave it either. I also didn't make the gym this week either, but I'm less torn 
up about that. I spent all day in the lab Sunday, and by the time I was done in 
the lab, the gym had closed. We'll try to make it happen this week. 

## What could make you happier?

Buy in from other people.

## Goals for Next Week

* Grind. I've one week to the paper deadline. 
* Solid to-do list for the week, including paper deadline goals
* Multiplex (not multi-task) between real implementation, simulation, and writing
* Get a complete paper draft together
* Gym once

## Strategies

Last week's strategy of doing the to-do list the night before works well when
you go to sleep thinking about work and wake up thinking about work, but if
there's anything in between it's almost worse. Because you made your notes with
some clear idea in mind but you've lost it. I think it's a good technique if you
have to wrap up a day earlier and or stuck, but I don't think it's something to
do every day necessarily. On the flip side -- doing it in the morning BEFORE
looking at your phone as has a very positive impact.

Focus:
* February strategy: No phone for the first 15 minutes of every day

Additional:
* Keep applying pomodoro technique through the coding grind
* Clean to-do lists for day and WEEK.
