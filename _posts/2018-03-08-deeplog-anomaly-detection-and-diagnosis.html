Authors: Min Du, Feifei Li, Guineng Zheng, Vivek Srikumar<br />Venue: &nbsp; &nbsp;CCS &nbsp;2017 (Conference on Computer and Communications Security)<br /><br />DeepLog presents a method for parsing system logs automatically using natural language processing techniques, and an LSTM. The paper makes a few assumptions, such as a fixed set of log entry types, called keys. DeepLog constructs workflows from the underlying system log so that once an anomaly is detected, root cause analysis can be performed. <i>Need to do a deeper dive on this.</i><br /><i><a href="https://www.cs.utah.edu/~lifeifei/papers/deeplog.pdf"><br /></a></i><a href="https://www.cs.utah.edu/~lifeifei/papers/deeplog.pdf">Full Text</a>
