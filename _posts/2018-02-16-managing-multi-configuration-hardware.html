<div style="color: #24292e; font-size: 16px;">Authors:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ashutosh S. Dhodapkar and James E. Smith (U. Wisconsin - Madison)<br />Venue:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ISCA 2002</div><div style="color: #24292e; font-size: 16px;"><br /></div>This paper is one of the first to propose working set signatures to detect and recall program phases. This eliminates the need for re-training phases, and can also be used to predict features like proper cache size. The signature is generated by hashing each branches into an N-bit vector. The vector is <i>unweighted meaning</i> that, it simply encapsulates whether or not the hash of a branch was seen. They use 128 byte vectors for 100K instruction windows (fine grain). This paper should mainly be seen as a building block, as it is some of the earlier work in phase detection. Key issues are: too frequently sampling (every branch committed), too frequent changes (100K instructions, doesn't account for cost of context switch), and targeted reconfiguration (instruction cache size -- typical programs now multiple MB).<br /><ul><li>This paper has good information about average phase length for Spec2000 programs.&nbsp;</li><li>This paper has an excellent explanation of Rajeev's algorithm from "Memory Hierarchy Reconfiguration for Energy and Performance in General Purpose Architectures".</li></ul><div><a href="http://minds.wisconsin.edu/bitstream/handle/1793/11180/file_1.pdf?sequence=1" style="font-size: 16px;">Full Text</a></div>
