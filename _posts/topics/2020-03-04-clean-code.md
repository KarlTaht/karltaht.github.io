## The 5S Philosophy

Right off the bat, this book captured me with this notion of the "5S philosophy",
a methodology centered around maintaing high productivity workspaces. The origins 
are rooted in Japanese culture, and intially developed for manufacturing and 
maintenance. 

1. _Seiri_ (Sort)
    * Tasks should be prioritized and simple. 
2. _Seiton_ (Systemization)
    * The environment should support the productivity of tasks by through
its orderliness.
3. _Seiso_ (Shine)
    * To maintain an orderly system, we must devote explicit time to cleaning and
sustaining it.
4. _Seiketsu_ (Standardize)
    * All practices must be standardized. When things diverge from a standard, systemization
is lost. 
5. _Shitsuke_ (Sustain)
    * Self-discipline. All techniques must be continuously applied to achieve
their ultimate goal.
