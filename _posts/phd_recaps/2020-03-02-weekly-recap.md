## Notable Accomplishments:
* Implemented RL Simulation
* Wrote majority of paper submission


## Sitrep

Before diving into this, I want to note two important things. Firstly, I had a 
paper scheduled for Monday, February 24th. On Monday, February 24th, I found out
the deadline was extended by one week to March 2nd. It's kind of like having massive
stress about a deadline for 1 week, failing to hit that deadline, then reliving that
week again. Icing on the cake is, because of a friend's Bachelor party, I spent
February 24th to March 2nd down in Texas, away from the lab and my usual setup. 


## What Worked Well?

If it's not clear -- the past two weeks were objectively high stress. Paper deadline.
Last minute changes. Paper extension. Traveling. Bachelor party vs paper. Being
a a good friend vs being a good employee. Boom. And that's when it hit me. My job
right now is to be a student, a PhD student. That implies responsibility to perform
research and publish papers. However, that is only _part_ of what defines me. 

I think the most pivotal moment was Friday night, the Monday before the extended
deadline. I was supposed to spend the weekend down in Austin, yet it was clear
this paper had no chance for success if I devoted the next days to partying instead
of this paper. On one hand, being there to celebrate my friend is key. On the other, 
this is my PhD we're talking about. It was in the kitchen, sipping a cup of black
coffee that I compromised, because, I wasn't willing to sacrifice either entirely. I
spent a day in Austin, and the next back in Dallas. My paper still didn't make it. 

Jokes aside, I realized the decisions I was making we're just about me being a PhD
student and the obligations there. My decisions reflect my character as a friend. 
I feel good about both sides. 

## What Needs Improvement?

Let's not pretend there isn't room for improvement. I spent the week staying with
a friend, and no doubt it drew my focus. I allocated my time poorly, and lacked
the tenacity to buckle down during the day. As a result, my worked hours were
significantly down. Just need to keep improving my will power and mental fortitude.

## What could make you happier?

Experiment with strategies for productivity and success.

## Goals for Next Week

* Full refactor of code
* Get the disseration of previous works ported

## Strategies

Failed the 15-minutes on the phone thing around mid-way through last month, but
got some good take aways. Will report more in the monthly post.
