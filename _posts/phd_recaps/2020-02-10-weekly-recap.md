## Notable Accomplishments:

* Massive success in executing Lyndsey's 25th birthday
* Connected PCM Monitoring into Python
* Built data logger framework
* Built out [DDM website](https://datadrivenmotorsports.github.io/) (might look familiar)
* Gym goal maintained!


## What Worked Well?

Having a clear goal this week was awesome. During Monday - Wednesday, the goal was
really just to work on research. On Monday that didn't quite happen, because of a 
snowday and the massive 7 day straight grind, but, Tuesday and Wednesday were very
productive. Thursday, I turned my focus to the main goal this week: absolutely 
slaying Lyndsey's 25th birthday. Sometimes you have to take a step back from craziness
and remember what really matters to you. For me, that's easily my wife. And if I
need to choose taking a 3 day weekend + a half day so I can deliver an awesome
once-in-a-lifetime type birthday, hell yeah I'm gonna do it. I can't say it helped
my research, but I priorized and succeeding in not only her birthday, but also 
enjoying the weekend myself. 

## What Needs Improvement?

There are three areas I want to touch on:
1. Planning out in detail beyond one day
2. Staying accountable
3. Pomodoro and focus

Regarding point **1**, I've been focused on the maximizing my daily grind and also producing
high quality code. I feel I've been rushing as is (turns out the single responsibility
principle is non-trivial), and still falling behind the "schedule". I use quotes
because in reality, I haven't planned things out in too much detail because of two
main reasons: fear and focus. On one hand, I'm scared of the time table and requirements,
as I know this deadline is pretty damn unrealistic. On the other hand, I also knew
I had spent too much time planning, and wanted to spend more time doing. If I take
a step back from the deadline, I am very happy with my rate of progress. Nevertheless,
it's not quite enough. I need to make some sort of high level time table (**1**),
and stay accountable to that time table (**2**).

Despite some very productive days, there also points where I am exceedingly unproductive
for extended periods. It looks something like this: start focusing on problem. 
Realize problem has many feasible solutions. Try to choose a solution. Get stuck. 
Check Facebook Messenger. The Pomodoro technique (**3**) is explicitly meant to conquer
that "stuckness" and prevail over set backs. I'll be working to employ it as much
as possible this week. 

## What could make you happier?

I really just want all of this to come together. It feels like that would be just
magic if it did, but hey, sometimes you have to ask for the impossible. 

## Goals for Next Week

* Freaking. Grind. I need 60+ hours this week if I have any hopes for success. 
* Gym at least once
* RL End-to-End
* Schedule defense
* Example with differing workloads
* Abstract, Introduction and Design

## Strategies
Focus:
* February strategy: No phone for the first 15 minutes of every day
* Plan the to-do list the night before

Additional:
* Keep applying pomodoro technique through the coding grind
* Clean to-do lists for day and WEEK.
