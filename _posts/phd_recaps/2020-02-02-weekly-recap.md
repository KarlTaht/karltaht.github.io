## Metrics Tracking

Going to track time and some other hard metrics. We'll see how many I keep.

## Notable Accomplishments:

* Submitted Paper to Conference
* Applied for Graduation
* Back to the gym!
* Successful reading club presentation
* Pre-defense meeting with a committee member - 2 more to go.

## What Worked Well?

*This week was a cluster f@$&!* I think I realized that fully by Wednesay. As a result, 
I more or less treated like Tuesday/Wednesday as my "working weekend", and told
myself I'd put in full-time days on the weekend. And I did! I realized the state
of affairs and made a decision. While at the time it felt like procastination, it was a
good trade off. My daily to-do list were long, but of mostly shorter tasks. This is
a list of what I had going on this week:

* Paper re-write for resubmission
* Graduation logistics (actually confusing as hell)
* Scheduling meetings with 3 professors for my PhD proposal reviews
* Preparing for those meetings
* Reading and presenting a paper for arch reading club
* RiTC Workshop website logistics
* RiTC Workshop registration??

Seriously, way to much to make any real progress on my main research...**until the
weekend.** I came in to the lab both Saturday in Sunday and wrote about 1000 lines of code.

## What Needs Improvement?

As easy as it is to justify the craziness, I'd be lying if I didn't admit some things
slipped through the cracks. For instance, I wasn't able to secure a sponsorship for traveling
to HPCA, so I wanted to check in with Rajeev before registering. Normally, he is
always in attendance at reading club, which was coincidentally also the last day
of early registration. Unfortunately, he wasn't able to make it, and I totally 
spaced on following up -- oof. Explainable, yes. Acceptable, no. If I do go to HPCA,
I'll fork over my own money for the registration. 

The other major thing that I should touch on is momentum. I find between 4-6 hours into
a day, my productivity tanks. Like seriously. Hours one and two I'm at like 110%. Hours three and four, 85-90%. Hour 5 boom. 50%. Either that or I take a pause to eat lunch or something, and I lose my momentum completely. My initial thought was to get up and move around -- and I think that's right -- but, where you move is critical. For instance, if you've lost your momentum then come home you're going to cave into entertainment. I think moving around, walking, and then maybe moving to an alternate productive environment is the way to go. 

As an example, today after about 5 hours of coding, I enjoyed a 15 minute walk through crisp winter air to the library. I setup in my favorite corner, surrounded by the wonderful musty smell of old books, and 
got to reading a paper. After an hour of active  reading, I felt like I had digested a really complex paper and wrote a summary I'm happy with. So yes, moving in itself is good, but perhaps more importantly, moving to a space which fosters productivity is even better. 

## What could make you happier?

I really enjoy the time and metrics tracking, but I want to streamline it. While
the time tracking is pretty quick (I do it all with an app), the other metrics
aren't streamlined yet and take a bit longer to compile. Would be nice to do that
quicker without feeling like I'm wasting time compiling extraneous information...
what can I say, I love data? 

## Goals for Next Week

* Make Lyndsey's 25th birthday awesome
* Hit the gym at least once
* End-to-end reinforcement learning on real system implementation
* Start paper and nail down the story
* Read 2 papers

## Strategies
* February strategy: No phone for the first 15 minutes of every day
* Keep applying pomodoro technique through the coding grind
* Experiment with changing the environment
