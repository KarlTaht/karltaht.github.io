as kind of hybrid between a personal sprint and freeform journaling"

## Time Tracking

Still unsure how to categorize things, but getting better

## Notable Accomplishments:

* Implemented Reinforcement Learning Synthetic environment using A2C framework
* Moved back SLC and am setup for maximum attack!
* Logistical graduation requirements squared
* Paper Registered for ICS 2020

## What Worked Well?

It's definitely nice being back in the lab and having a place to go work,
particularly when my wife is around. When I work from home and she leaves from
work, it kind of feels like I'm still just at home and not in "work mode". Having
an office to go to when she's around is definitely needed to keep that focus. 

## What Needs Improvement?

I was sloppy with some of my bullet journal tasks, and as a result a lot of stuff
either didn't get done or was migrated. My goals need to be a little bit more
well thought through. If the goal is to setup a framework but it's not clear what
the requirements are, the task should be setting up the requirements. More tasks
can always be added as they arise, rather than trying to make up stuff. Also need 
to be honest about the to-do list for this paper submission. The biggest "oof"
this week was missing a time sensitive email by a full 24 hours. Felt bad. 

## What could make you happier?

Two main things bring me down: missing something critical and feeling like there's
no time for fun. Organization is going to be key to make sure things don't slip
through the cracks and bite me. Staying focused will help me ensure there IS
time to enjoy life, too. 

## Goals for Next Week

* Take care when making daily goals
* Finalize PhD committee
* Finish revisions for ICS submission
* Start writing MICRO submission
* Detailed Goal list for MICRO submission
* Measurements for simulation parameters
* Progress on simulation environment
