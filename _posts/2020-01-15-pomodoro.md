One thing about studying, or really, any kind of working that has limited human
interaction faces one key challenge: staying focused. I think that's true now 
more than ever with cell phones, social media, email. Everything is trying to 
pull us away from what we're working on right now. We can make to-do list's and
stay organized, but eventually we will have to sit down and simply use our mind.

The first thing is -- don't discredit your to-lists and organizations. I keep
a journal, more specifically, a bullet journal, to track all my daily, monthly,
and longer term goals. Once you have these tasks distilled to a reasonable level,
you at least know where you focus __should__ be, and that's step one. Now, how
do you force yourself to focus? 

## Flow

There's this really interesting chart that demonstrates this notion of "flow", 
when we are focused on what we are doing and happy, and by extension, most 
productive. In reality, its really hard to achieve this state. Maybe your 
current projectis boring because it's too easy. Maybe it's intimidating and 
even starting stresses you out. So, is there a way we can force ourselves into
flow? 

## The Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro techinque is exceedingly simple, and involves disecting time into
manageable increments. You'll work in 25-minute "sprints" with short breaks, and
after 4 of these sprints, you'll take a longer break. Let's lay it out:

1. Select the task you want to work on. If you have your to-do list, this should
be easy.
2. Set a 25-minute timer. Eliminate all disractions and dive into the task at 
hand, and nothing else. No checking Facebook, emails, messages, etc. You work
until the timer goes off. The Pomodoro begins. 
3. Physically WRITE a check-mark down on the paper. You've completed a Pomodoro.
4. Take a short break for 3-5 minutes. Grab yourself a drink, check those IMs. 
Do something NOT work related. 
5. Every 4 pomodoros, take a longer break like 20-30 minutes. I call a group
of 4 pomodoros a "pomodoro session".

I think what I love about this technique is how simple it is. One of my "to-do"
items every day now includes "Pomodoro Sessions x ..." based on how much time I 
think I have to work that day. Now I'll be honest, sessions 1 and 2 usually go
really well for me, but the 3rd session is usually a significantly harder. 

Full disclosure, I used this technique a lot in early 2019 when I first started
working completely from home, and had a good amount of success. I completely
forgot about it however, after returning from my internship. I only recently 
recalled and it put it back to use, and I'm really pleased with the results. 
Time to hit 2020 running!
