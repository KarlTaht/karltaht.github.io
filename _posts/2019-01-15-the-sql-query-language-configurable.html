Authors: Kian Win Ong, Yannis Papakonstantinous, Romain Vernoux<br />Venue:&nbsp; &nbsp; arXiv 2015<br /><br />This work presents specifications for a new unified query language: SQL++. Modern databases have evolved beyond structured tables of SQL into semi-structured formats comprising of heterogenous structures. These structures may include different scalar types, tuples, ordered and unordered collections, which are common in JSON files. SQL++ provides backwards compatibility with SQL, but expands it with JSON features. SQL++ is flexible in that may operations including equivalence, comparison, and null/missing references can have explicitly configurable behaviors. Such configuration allows for portability to both SQL and NoSQL databases. The paper covers FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, and SELECT. It is noted that the NoSQL space is relatively new and thus likely to continue to develop. Thus, the key contributions of the work are itemizing and rationalizing the options of a language designer, and by extension, demonstrating the abilities of NoSQL databases in an abstracted fashion.<br /><br /><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.3631.pdf">Full Text</a>
