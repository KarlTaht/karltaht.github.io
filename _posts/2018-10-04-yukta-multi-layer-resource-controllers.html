Authors:&nbsp; Raghavendra Pothukuchi, Sweta Pothukuchi, Petros Voulgaris, Josep Torrellas<br />Venue:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ISCA 2018<br /><br />This work targets optimization of difference resources within a computer. The specific example used targets minimizing the energy-delay product via thread scheduling and DVFS on an Arm big.LITTLE board. This paper is done by the same authors of "Using MIMO Formal Control to Maximize Resource Efficiency in Architectures". While the prior work synthesizes many simultaneous optimization problems into a single controller, this work separates out the controllers into coordinated multi-layer formal controllers, specifically Structured Singular Value controllers. The SSV controllers offer the benefits of uncertainty guardbands for safety, max and min settings, discrete value support, and allow for passing information between multiple controllers. They call their generic framework Yukta (possibly named after the 1999 Miss World winner).<br /><br />The key idea is that this approach allows for subject matter experts in different areas of the chip to use their own domain-expertise to create individually optimized controllers. However, because of the specific design and coordination, the controllers can work together. The authors show that the performance increases 38%, and energy delay product by 50%. The results seem almost too good to be true, but the authors provide a compelling experiment where they show that existing implementations oscillate, causing sub-optimal performance whereas Yukta converges quickly and without oscillation.<br /><br /><a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3276589">Full Text</a>
