<br />Authors: Archana Ganapathi, Kaushik Datta, Armando Fox, David Patterson<br />Venue: USENIX Hot Topics in Parallelism 2009<br /><br />This workshop paper examines applying a machine learning technique to auto-tuning HPC stencils. The configuration space consists of 5 independent knobs resulting in a total of ~4 million possible configurations. The work applies KCCA (kernel canonical correlation analysis) which finds correlations between two sets of data, in this case performance measurements and tune settings. KCCA is a specific way to do this that allows for non-linear relationships. Compared to feature extraction techniques, this is a direct way to find correlations rather than just using an intermediate step of feature extraction followed by a method of clustering. The main reason this appears to be only a workshop paper is that only two experiments are performed, both using stencils. The KCCA algorithm is definitely worth a deeper understanding, as the results are promising.<br /><br /><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0e4b/886ba6c47faa4c38fc33316ca9e6124eb37f.pdf">Full Text</a><br /><br /><br /><br />
