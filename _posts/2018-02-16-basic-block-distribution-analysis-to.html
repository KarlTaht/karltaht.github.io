Authors:&nbsp; &nbsp;Tim Sherwood, Erez Perelman, Brad Calder (UC San Diego)<br />Venue:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PACT 2001<br /><br />As the title states, the key problem this paper seeks to solve is finding simulation points. To do this, they come up with basic block vectors analysis (BBVA). BBVA uses BBV's, which can be collected in an environment more similar to running the default program than simulation, and as a result, is many orders of magnitude quicker than simulation. They use the BBV's to determine the relative sizes of each phase, i.e., how much duration of program execution they represent. Then using other tricks such as Fourier analysis, they are also able to analyze the cyclic behavior.<br /><br /><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/da03/9f07358625a47ce36cc4f333718a1315c9f3.pdf">Full Text</a><br /><div><br /></div>
