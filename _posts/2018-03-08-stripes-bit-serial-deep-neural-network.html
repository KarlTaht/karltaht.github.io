Authors: Patrick Judd, Jorge Albericio, Tayler Hetherington, Tor M. Aamodt, Andreas Moshovos<br />Venue: &nbsp; &nbsp;MICRO 2016<br /><br />Bit-Stripes presents are architecture which is able to scale almost linearly with the bit-precision width for neural networks. They do a design space exploration to find the minimum number of bits required for different networks to maintain within 1% accuracy of the original network. The paper takes a DaDianNao-like approach in terms of hardware, but thanks to the per-layer precision optimizations consumes less energy, and operates faster.<br /><a href="https://www.ece.ubc.ca/~aamodt/papers/stripes-final.pdf"><br /></a><a href="https://www.ece.ubc.ca/~aamodt/papers/stripes-final.pdf">Full Text</a>
