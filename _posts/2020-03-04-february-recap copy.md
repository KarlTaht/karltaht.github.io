February was, well, kind of awesome in all honesty. It's crazy how small decisions
snowball, and, how that can work for the better. Take this blog, this writing. It's
inspired me to make 2020 the year of growth.  I'm taking it upon myself to try as many
new strategies and as possible for self-improvement. I'm employing new "strategies"
and constantly experimenting with ways to improve my life.  I'm working to better
understand myself, and align my goals with my reality. While there's always 
things to do better, 2020 is on track to be an awesome year. I'm really excited
to see who I am at the end.


## Time Tracking

| Category | Time           | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| Research | 155 hr, 22 min | Wow. |
| Reading  | 4 hr, 41 min   | Academic and non-academic. |
| Writing  | 2 hr, 47 min   | Non-academic |


## Notable Accomplishments:

* My main research project is fully-implemented, now for fine tuning.
* My committee is finalized and tentative defense date set
*


## What Worked Well?

Mono-tasking. When you're in doing something, do it. If you're
chilling on the couch, chill. If you're at work, work. Be exactly where you are. 
Of all the things that have improved my happines, productivity, and generally
made me feel "successful", being in the moment is the key. Make no mistake--this
does not mean disregarding in the future, it just means not multi-tasking. The
real challenge _how_ to achieve this.

## What Needs Improvement?

Staying focused and getting re-focused. It's easier for things to break your
focus during the day -- a colleague walks in, a friend pings you on Facebook,
an email rolls in. Hell, it can even be internal "oh shoot, I need to...". When
we do that, we stop mono-tasking. Ultimately, if we keep adding to what we need
to do and keep switching between those things, we never actually get anything
completely done. But if we focus on _exactly one thing_, maybe, we can. I need
to find more strategies to pull myself back into focus after getting distracted.
Here's my current methods, or "toolbox" if you will:

* Start a Pomodoro session
* Put down my cellphone, and read for a fixed amount of time

## What could make you happier?

Take the things I want to do and integrate them into the things I have to do. I 
want to be a better developer, so I'm reading about good software practices and
applying that to my research. I want to be healthier, but I'm short on time and
motivation. So, I'm going to swap out beers for tea and coffee this month. Caffeine
is arguably healthier (or at least lower calorie) than beer, health box check. Alcohol
kills my productivity, so I'll buy back some time too. Let's see how this reallocation
of mental energy and physical time fair this month.

## Strategies for Next Month

* No cellphone use for the first 15 minutes of every _weekday_
  * Important when days need to be productive.
* Read 15 minutes each day
  * Setting aside time to explicitly learn
* Pomodoro as much as possible. 

## Goals for Next Month

* Break the cellphone rule fewer than 5 times
* Drink fewer than 5 days this month
* Hit the gym at least 3 times
