<h2 id="what-worked-well">What Worked Well?</h2>

<p>This week was a cluster! I think I realized that fully by Wednesay. As a result, 
I more or less treated like Tuesday/Wednesday as my ‚Äúworking weekend‚Äù, and told
myself I‚Äôd put in full-time days on the weekend. And I did! Realizing the state
of affairs was good, and while at the time it felt like procastination, it was a
good trade off. My daily to-do list were long, but of mostly shorter tasks. This is
a list of what I had going on this week</p>

<ul>
  <li>Paper re-write for resubmission</li>
  <li>Graduation logistics (actually confusing as hell)</li>
  <li>Scheduling meetings for 3 professors for my proposal</li>
  <li>Preparing for those meetings</li>
  <li>Reading and presenting a paper for arch reading club</li>
  <li>RiTC Workshop website logistics</li>
  <li>RiTC Workshop registration??</li>
</ul>

<p>Seriously, way to much to make any real progress on my main research‚Ä¶until the
weekend. I came in to the lab both Saturday in Sunday and wrote about 1000 lines of code.</p>

<h2 id="what-needs-improvement">What Needs Improvement?</h2>

<p>I was sloppy with some of my bullet journal tasks, and as a result a lot of stuff
either didn‚Äôt get done or was migrated. My goals need to be a little bit more
well thought through. If the goal is to setup a framework but it‚Äôs not clear what
the requirements are, the task should be setting up the requirements. More tasks
can always be added as they arise, rather than trying to make up stuff. Also need 
to be honest about the to-do list for this paper submission. The biggest ‚Äúoof‚Äù
this week was missing a time sensitive email by a full 24 hours. Felt bad.</p>

<h2 id="what-could-make-you-happier">What could make you happier?</h2>

<p>Two main things bring me down: missing something critical and feeling like there‚Äôs
no time for fun. Organization is going to be key to make sure things don‚Äôt slip
through the cracks and bite me. Staying focused will help me ensure there IS
time to enjoy life, too.</p>

<h2 id="goals-for-next-week">Goals for Next Week</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Take care when making daily goals</li>
  <li>Finalize PhD committee</li>
  <li>Finish revisions for ICS submission</li>
  <li>Start writing MICRO submission</li>
  <li>Detailed Goal list for MICRO submission</li>
  <li>Measurements for simulation parameters</li>
  <li>Progress on simulation environment</li>
</ul>
