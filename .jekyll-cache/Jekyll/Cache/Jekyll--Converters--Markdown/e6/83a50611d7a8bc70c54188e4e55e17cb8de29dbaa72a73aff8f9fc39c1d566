<h2 id="what-worked-well">What Worked Well?</h2>

<p>I told myself I was going to grind this week, and I definitely started that way.
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday I wrote an immense amount of code, which I think
is pretty well reflected in the 3400 lines of code changed this week. I bought a
new keyboard since my old one was wearing out, which was a welcome improvement
to the work environment. After Wednesday, I actually implemented the thing I had
hoped to build for over 3 years. Discussions and detailed plans helped make that
happen. I also really enjoyed my routine of no phone for the first 15 minutes in
the morning, and reading a Medium article over breakfast before starting the workday.</p>

<p>I also really enjoyed collaborating this week. I spoke up during a discussion about
a lab mates rebuttal and offered an idea. At first I was stressed ‚Äì I had my
own stuff to do that I was struggling with ‚Äì but, in reality I enjoyed sitting
with him in the lab and working out the solutions together. Definitely enjoyable.</p>

<h2 id="what-needs-improvement">What Needs Improvement?</h2>

<p>I still didn‚Äôt develop a true time table for exactly what needs to happen when,
so that‚Äôs an obvious setback. I think the really struggle this week though, was
simpler than that. I have wanted to integrate reinforcement learning (the real
state-of-the-art type algorithms) into my research for the better part of my PhD,
and on Wednsday I finally did that. I think the hardest part was that no one 
noticed, cared, or even asked about it.</p>

<p>We‚Äôve been trying to implement daily stand-ups in our lab, you know, Scrub style.
Unfortunately, rarely is everyone (or anyone?) in attendance besides myself and Mesyam.
A scrub with just two people doesn‚Äôt quite play well when you‚Äôre working on two
very different things.</p>

<p>There are three areas I want to touch on:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Planning out in detail beyond one day</li>
  <li>Staying accountable</li>
  <li>Pomodoro and focus</li>
</ol>

<p>Regarding point <strong>1</strong>, I‚Äôve been focused on the maximizing my daily grind and also producing
high quality code. I feel I‚Äôve been rushing as is (turns out the single responsibility
principle is non-trivial), and still falling behind the ‚Äúschedule‚Äù. I use quotes
because in reality, I haven‚Äôt planned things out in too much detail because of two
main reasons: fear and focus. On one hand, I‚Äôm scared of the time table and requirements,
as I know this deadline is pretty damn unrealistic. On the other hand, I also knew
I had spent too much time planning, and wanted to spend more time doing. If I take
a step back from the deadline, I am very happy with my rate of progress. Nevertheless,
it‚Äôs not quite enough. I need to make some sort of high level time table (<strong>1</strong>),
and stay accountable to that time table (<strong>2</strong>).</p>

<p>Despite some very productive days, there also points where I am exceedingly unproductive
for extended periods. It looks something like this: start focusing on problem. 
Realize problem has many feasible solutions. Try to choose a solution. Get stuck. 
Check Facebook Messenger. The Pomodoro technique (<strong>3</strong>) is explicitly meant to conquer
that ‚Äústuckness‚Äù and prevail over set backs. I‚Äôll be working to employ it as much
as possible this week.</p>

<h2 id="what-could-make-you-happier">What could make you happier?</h2>

<p>I really just want all of this to come together. It feels like that would be just
magic if it did, but hey, sometimes you have to ask for the impossible.</p>

<h2 id="goals-for-next-week">Goals for Next Week</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Freaking. Grind. I need 60+ hours this week if I have any hopes for success.</li>
  <li>Gym at least once</li>
  <li>RL End-to-End</li>
  <li>Schedule defense</li>
  <li>Example with differing workloads</li>
  <li>Abstract, Introduction and Design</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="strategies">Strategies</h2>
<p>Focus:</p>
<ul>
  <li>February strategy: No phone for the first 15 minutes of every day</li>
  <li>Plan the to-do list the night before</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Keep applying pomodoro technique through the coding grind</li>
