<p>Right off the bat, this book captured me with this notion of the “5S philosophy”,
a methodology centered around maintaing high productivity workspaces. The origins are of manufacturing,
but I have generalized them to be applicable more generally.</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Seiri</em> (Sort)</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Tasks should be prioritized and simple.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li><em>Seiton</em> (Systemization)</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>The environment should support the productivity of tasks by through
its orderliness.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-seiso-shine">3. <em>Seiso</em> (Shine)</h3>

<p>To maintain an orderly system, we must devote explicit time to cleaning and
sustaining it.</p>

<h3 id="4-seiketsu-standardize">4. <em>Seiketsu</em> (Standardize)</h3>

<p>All practices must be standardized. When things diverge from a standard, systemization
is lost.</p>

<h3 id="5-shitsuke-sustain">5. <em>Shitsuke</em> (Sustain)</h3>

<p>Self-discipline. All techniques must be continuously applied to achieve
their ultimate goal.</p>
