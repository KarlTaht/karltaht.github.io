I"ž<p>Since 2018, Iâ€™ve been summarizing every research paper I read. I find this helps
me remember works better, and recall them when I need to find relevant work. Iâ€™m
currently migrating those posts into this new GitHub-based site.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/research-papers/research/multi-resource-packing-for-cluster/">Multi-Resource Packing for Cluster Schedulers (Tetris)</a></p>

    <p>This work presents a resource-aware cluster scheduling scheme which maximizes performance and includes additional parameters to balance fairness requirements.</p>
