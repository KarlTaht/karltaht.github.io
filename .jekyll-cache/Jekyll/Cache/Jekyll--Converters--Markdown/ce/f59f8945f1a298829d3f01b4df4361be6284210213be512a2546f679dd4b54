<h2 id="what-worked-well">What Worked Well?</h2>

<p>I told myself I was going to grind this week, and I definitely started that way.
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday I wrote an immense amount of code, which I think
is pretty well reflected in the 3400 lines of code changed this week. I bought a
new keyboard since my old one was wearing out, which was a welcome improvement
to the work environment. After Wednesday, I actually implemented the thing I had
hoped to build for over 3 years. Discussions and detailed plans helped make that
happen. I also really enjoyed my routine of no phone for the first 15 minutes in
the morning, and reading a Medium article over breakfast before starting the workday.</p>

<p>I also really enjoyed collaborating this week. I spoke up during a discussion about
a lab mates rebuttal and offered an idea. At first I was stressed â€“ I had my
own stuff to do that I was struggling with â€“ but, in reality I enjoyed sitting
with him in the lab and working out the solutions together. Definitely enjoyable.</p>

<h2 id="what-needs-improvement">What Needs Improvement?</h2>

<p>I still didnâ€™t develop a true time table for exactly what needs to happen when,
so thatâ€™s an obvious setback. I think the really struggle this week though, was
simpler than that. I have wanted to integrate reinforcement learning (the real
state-of-the-art type algorithms) into my research for the better part of my PhD,
and on Wednsday I finally did that. I think the hardest part was that no one 
noticed, cared, or even asked about it. Iâ€™m well aware Iâ€™m not as self-motivated
as I should be, but, that somehow felt like a major accomplishment. I need to
find a way to bounce back faster.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ve been trying to implement daily stand-ups in our lab, you know, Scrum style.
Unfortunately, rarely is everyone (or anyone?) in attendance besides myself and Mesyam.
A scrum with just two people doesnâ€™t quite play well when youâ€™re working on two
very different things. So clearly thatâ€™s not the answer either.</p>

<p>Perhaps worst of all, this weekend I failed in my monthly goal â€“ no phone for
the first 15 minutes of the day now 3 times. This was mostly a result of the weekend,
I wanted to sleep in, and more importantly, so did Lyndsey. I think itâ€™s already
hard to leave a comfy bed, but itâ€™s harder when your partner doesnâ€™t want you to
leave it either. I also didnâ€™t make the gym this week either, but Iâ€™m less torn 
up about that. I spent all day in the lab Sunday, and by the time I was done in 
the lab, the gym had closed. Weâ€™ll try to make it happen this week.</p>

<h2 id="what-could-make-you-happier">What could make you happier?</h2>

<p>Buy in from other people. I know thatâ€™s a lot to ask.</p>

<h2 id="goals-for-next-week">Goals for Next Week</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Grind. Iâ€™ve one week to the paper deadline.</li>
  <li>Solid to-do list for the week, including paper deadline goals</li>
  <li>Multiplex (not multi-task) between real implementation and simulation framework</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="strategies">Strategies</h2>
<p>Focus:</p>
<ul>
  <li>February strategy: No phone for the first 15 minutes of every day</li>
  <li>Plan the to-do list the night before</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Keep applying pomodoro technique through the coding grind</li>
  <li>Clean to-do lists for day and WEEK.</li>
</ul>
