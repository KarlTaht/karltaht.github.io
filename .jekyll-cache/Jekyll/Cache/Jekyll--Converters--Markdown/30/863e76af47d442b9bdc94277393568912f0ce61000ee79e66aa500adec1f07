<h2 id="what-worked-well">What Worked Well?</h2>

<p>Having a clear goal this week was awesome. During Monday - Wednesday, the goal was
really just to work on research. On Monday that didn‚Äôt quite happen, because of a 
snowday and the massive 7 day straight grind, but, Tuesday and Wednesday were very
productive. Thursday, I turned my focus to the main goal this week: absolutely 
slaying Lyndsey‚Äôs 25th birthday. Sometimes you have to take a step back from craziness
and remember what really matters to you. For me, that‚Äôs easily my wife. And if I
need to choose taking a 3 day weekend + a half day so I can deliver an awesome
once-in-a-lifetime type birthday, hell yeah I‚Äôm gonna do it. I can‚Äôt say it helped
my research, but I priorized and succeeding in not only her birthday, but also 
enjoying the weekend myself.</p>

<h2 id="what-needs-improvement">What Needs Improvement?</h2>

<p>There are three areas I want to touch on:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Planning out in detail beyond one day</li>
  <li>Staying accountable</li>
  <li>Pomodoro and focus</li>
</ol>

<p>Regarding point <strong>1</strong>, I‚Äôve been focused on the maximizing my daily grind and also producing
high quality code. I feel I‚Äôve been rushing as is (turns out the single responsibility
principle is non-trivial), and still falling behind the ‚Äúschedule‚Äù. I use quotes
because in reality, I haven‚Äôt planned things out in too much detail because of two
main reasons: fear and focus. On one hand, I‚Äôm scared of the time table and requirements,
as I know this deadline is pretty damn unrealistic. On the other hand, I also knew
I had spent too much time planning, and wanted to spend more time doing. If I take
a step back from the deadline, I am very happy with my rate of progress. Nevertheless,
it‚Äôs not quite enough. I need to make some sort of high level time table (<strong>1</strong>),
and stay accountable to that time table (<strong>2</strong>).</p>

<p>Despite some very productive days, there also points where I am exceedingly unproductive
for extended periods. It looks something like this: start focusing on problem. 
Realize problem has many feasible solutions. Try to choose a solution. Get stuck. 
Check Facebook Messenger. The Pomodoro technique (<strong>3</strong>) is explicitly meant to conquer
that ‚Äústuckness‚Äù and prevail over set backs. I‚Äôll be working to employ it as much
as possible this week.</p>

<h2 id="what-could-make-you-happier">What could make you happier?</h2>

<p>I really just want all of this to come together. It feels like that would be just
magic if it did, but hey, sometimes you have to ask for the impossible.</p>
