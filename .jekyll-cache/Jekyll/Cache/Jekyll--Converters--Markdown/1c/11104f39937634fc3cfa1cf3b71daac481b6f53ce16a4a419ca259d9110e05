I"»<p>Iâ€™m a 5th year PhD student studying Computer Science at the University of Utah. 
But Iâ€™m also a husband, avid car enthusiast, and general nerd. But perhaps most
importantly, my passion in life is continual self-improvement. This page is a 
place for me to document and reflect strategies, plans, and actions.</p>

<h3 id="my-research">My Research</h3>

<p>While I work in the Architecture lab, my main research project is closer to software and systems. My thesis centralizes around program phase detection and both hardware and software performance optimization, all with a machine learning flavor. Through my research, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to intern with Intel Labs twice were I worked on these problems from a hardware engineerâ€™s perspective. More recently, I have shifted my focus towards warehouse scale performance optimization. I recently completed an internship at Facebook with the Warehouse Java Efficiency team, where I plans to join full-time in 2020.</p>

<h3 id="research-papers">Research Papers</h3>

<p>I try to read papers pretty regularly, at least one per-week. I maintained <a href="https://researchdoneright.blogspot.com/">separate blog</a> because of the tagging support, which makes it easy to find papers. Iâ€™m currently working to migrate those functionalities
to this page. If youâ€™re looking for a topic and want a quick summary of the paper in words other than the authors, check it out. I try to remain as unbiased as possible in my reviews, but I donâ€™t promise 100% accuracy in replicating the authorâ€™s intent. After all, my posts often distort the paper to emphasize elements relevant to my search â€“ dynamic hardware, auto-tuning, and machine learning approaches.</p>
