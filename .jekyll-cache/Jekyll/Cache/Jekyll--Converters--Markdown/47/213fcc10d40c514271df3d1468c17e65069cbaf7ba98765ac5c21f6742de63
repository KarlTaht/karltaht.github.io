I"e<p>This paper presents a framework to perform asynchronous gradient descent for 
optimization of deep nerual networks in the scope of reinforcement learning
problems. Most importantly, this work presents the asynchronous advantage 
actor-critic framework (A3C), which is currently one of the state-of-the-art
frameworks for deep reinforcement learning.</p>
