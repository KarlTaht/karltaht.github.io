I"[<p>If you’re anything like me, you often find yourself reading or learning about
new techniques to improve yourself and your life. I think when you come across
these ideas they seem new and fresh and at face value always make a lot of sense.
The problem is that if you follow something like the self-improvement section on
Medium, you’ll be getting doses of new and fresh ideas everyday. One one hand,
this is really good. Things that are new keep us energized and excited to work
on ourselves. On the other hand, it really muddies the field in terms of what is 
important and what’s not. What really works versus what’s just interesting to 
consider. However, there’s one article that summarized some “Rules to Live By”
if you will, that I think are very powerful. I’m going to present them with my
own spin, and try to order it as well.</p>
