I"v<p>February was, well, kind of awesome in all honesty. It’s crazy how small decisions
snowball, and, how that can work for the better. Take this blog, this writing. It’s
inspired me to make 2020 the year of growth.  I’m taking it upon myself to try as many
new strategies and as possible for self-improvement. I’m employing new “strategies”
and constantly experimenting with ways to improve my life.  I’m working to better
understand myself, and align my goals with my reality. While there’s always 
things to do better, 2020 is on track to be an awesome year. I’m really excited
to see who I am at the end.</p>
