I"M<p>Well, since I’m wrapping up weeks, I might as well wrap up months too, right?</p>

<h2 id="time-tracking">Time Tracking</h2>

<p>This is going to be a bit messy since I’ve only recently started being more
diligent, so bear in mind – a lot of missing hours!</p>

<h2 id="what-worked-well">What Worked Well?</h2>

<p>Firstly, it has been awesome to get time to work on my car. It’s my longest standing
passion in life (thanks Apa), bar none. Being in the garage was just so theraputic. 
You pour literal blood, sweat, and tears into a project and at the end your can
actually see what you did. You can experience what you did. And in the words of
David, the car is “sensory overload”, exactly what you need to clear a head as
inflated as mine. Hey at least I’m self-aware about my self-admiration, right?</p>

<p>Getting back to the grind started out alright. For one, this <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/pages/learn">bullet journal</a> 
technique has been awesome. It’s nice to have a daily to-do list notebook, but,
one that’s a bit more structured. I definitely feel it adding value. In fact,
as a general prinicple I feel structure is the key ingredient for productivy, 
but paradoxically, chaos is the key incredient for inspiration and motivation.</p>

<h2 id="what-needs-improvement">What Needs Improvement?</h2>

<p>I think it’s a balance. I seem to either spending too much time planning things
out too intricately on the larger scale, but then whip together an unrealistic
or unthoughtful daily todo list. Balancing having a good structure, yet having flexibility
when things don’t go to plan. And the antitode to this: a balanced strategy.</p>

<p>In terms of action, I’m looking forward to getting into a morning routine. For 
one, I bought an alarm clock because I have a very simple goal: to start the day
for the first 15 minutes without my phone. I’m going to attempt to do this every
day in February. I’ll mention I’ve given it a test drive, and I haven’t had a bad
day that starts without my phone. This is one clear change I’ll be making.</p>

<p>Yet, this action must be met with reflection to evaluate how well strategies
are working. Looking back on the past month (like I am now), is very subjective
in many ways. It gives a chance to take a high level view and see what’s missing,
or equally, what needs to be removed from my life. The weekly check-ins are going
to be</p>

<h2 id="what-could-make-you-happier">What could make you happier?</h2>

<p>I think this is the hardest one to answer, because what I truly desire is to change
the reality I’m in. I’m finishing up this PhD, but I want so badly to be done 
and to start working. I want to be back at Facebook, loving my job everday and
working with awesome people, in a concentrated team. I want to sleep next to my
wife every night, not a few times a month. I want to go track my car every weekend.
I’m working towards this as absolute best as possible, but what could make me 
happier now? Maximizing my confidence that future I just described becomes reality.</p>
