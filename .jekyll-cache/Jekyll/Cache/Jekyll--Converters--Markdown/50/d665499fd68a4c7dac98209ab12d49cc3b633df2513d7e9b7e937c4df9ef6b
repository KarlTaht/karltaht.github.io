I"“<p>Since 2018, Iâ€™ve been summarizing every research paper I read. I find this helps

currently migrating those posts into this new GitHub-based site.<input type="text" id="search" class="search-input" tabindex="-1" placeholder="Enter your search term..." />
    &lt;div id="results" class="results"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>
