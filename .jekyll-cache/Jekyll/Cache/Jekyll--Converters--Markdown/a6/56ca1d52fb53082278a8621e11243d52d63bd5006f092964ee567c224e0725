<h2 id="what-worked-well">What Worked Well?</h2>

<p>Cutting down on multi-tasking. When you‚Äôre in doing something, do it. If you‚Äôre
chilling on the couch, chill. If you‚Äôre at work, work. Be exactly where you are. 
Of all the things that have improved my happines, productivity, and generally
made me feel ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù, being in the moment is the key. Make no mistake‚Äìthis
does not mean disregarding in the future, it just means not multi-tasking. The
real challenge <em>how</em> to achieve this.</p>

<h2 id="what-needs-improvement">What Needs Improvement?</h2>

<p>I think it‚Äôs a balance. I seem to either spending too much time planning things
out too intricately on the larger scale, but then whip together an unrealistic
or unthoughtful daily todo list. Balancing having a good structure, yet having flexibility
when things don‚Äôt go to plan. And I‚Äôm thinking, the antitode to this? A balanced strategy.</p>

<p>In terms of action, I‚Äôm looking forward to getting into a morning routine. For 
one, I bought an alarm clock because I have a very simple goal: to start the day
for the first 15 minutes without my phone. I‚Äôm going to attempt to do this every
day in February. I‚Äôve given it a few test drives, and I haven‚Äôt had a bad
day that starts without my phone. This is one clear change I‚Äôll be making.</p>

<p>Yet, this action must be met with reflection to evaluate how well strategies
are working. Looking back on the past month (like I am now), is very subjective
in many ways. It gives a chance to take a high level view and see what‚Äôs missing,
or equally, what needs to be removed from my life. One key thing I learned is, 
when you have a good block of time to simply grind something out, the <a href="https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique">Pomodoro technique</a> 
is great. But if you have a day scattered with meetings, or a lot of 
small tasks to knock out ‚Äì it‚Äôs not well suited for that. For instance, I considered
setting a goal ‚Äú2 pomodoro sessions a day‚Äù, but it‚Äôs simply not realistic because
the type of work I do is so varied.</p>

<h2 id="what-could-make-you-happier">What could make you happier?</h2>

<p>I think this is the hardest one to answer, because what I truly desire is to change
the reality I‚Äôm in. I‚Äôm finishing up this PhD, but I want so badly to be done 
and to start working. I want to be back at Facebook, loving my job everday and
working with awesome people, in a concentrated team. I want to sleep next to my
wife every night, not a few times a month. I want to go track or wrench on my car every weekend.
I‚Äôm working towards this as absolute best as possible, but what could make me 
happier now? Maximizing my confidence that future I just described becomes reality.</p>

<h2 id="strategies-for-next-month">Strategies for Next Month</h2>

<p>This year I‚Äôm taking it upon myself to try as many new strategies and as possible
for self-improvement. On a roughly weekly basis, I‚Äôm employing a new strategy, 
examples so far are‚Ä¶ the pomodoro technique, not using my cell phone for 15 
minutes each day, and bullet journaling. Up next is going to be reading 15 minutes
each day.</p>

<ul>
  <li>No cellphone use for the first 15 minutes of every <em>weekday</em></li>
  <li>Read 15 minutes each day</li>
  <li>Pomodoro as much as possible.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="goals-for-next-month">Goals for Next Month</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Break the cellphone rule fewer than 5 times</li>
  <li>Drink fewer than 5 days this month</li>
  <li>Hit the gym at least 3 times</li>
</ul>
