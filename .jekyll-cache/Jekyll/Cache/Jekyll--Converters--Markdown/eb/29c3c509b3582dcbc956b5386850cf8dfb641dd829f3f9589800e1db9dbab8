I"œ<p>One thing about studying, or really, any kind of working that has limited human
interaction faces one key challenge: staying focused. I think thatâ€™s true now 
more than ever with cell phones, social media, email. Everything is trying to 
pull us away from what weâ€™re working on right now. We can make to-do listâ€™s and
stay organized, but eventually we will have to sit down and simply use our mind.</p>
