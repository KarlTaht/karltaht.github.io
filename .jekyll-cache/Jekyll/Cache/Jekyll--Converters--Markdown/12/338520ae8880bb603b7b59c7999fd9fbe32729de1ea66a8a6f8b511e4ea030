I"a<p>This paper presents a framework to perform asynchronous gradient descent for 
optimization of deep nerual networks in the scope of reinforcement learning
problems. Most importantly, this work presents the asynchronous advantage 
actor-critic framework (A3C), which is currently thought of as the state-of-the-art
for deep reinforcement learning.</p>
