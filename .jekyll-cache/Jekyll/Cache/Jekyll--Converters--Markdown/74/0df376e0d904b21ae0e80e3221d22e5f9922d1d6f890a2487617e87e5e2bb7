<h2 id="notable-accomplishments">Notable Accomplishments:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>My main research project is fully-implemented, now for fine tuning.</li>
  <li>My committee is finalized and tentative defense date set
*</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-worked-well">What Worked Well?</h2>

<p>Mono-tasking. When you‚Äôre in doing something, do it. If you‚Äôre
chilling on the couch, chill. If you‚Äôre at work, work. Be exactly where you are. 
Of all the things that have improved my happines, productivity, and generally
made me feel ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù, being in the moment is the key. Make no mistake‚Äìthis
does not mean disregarding in the future, it just means not multi-tasking. The
real challenge <em>how</em> to achieve this.</p>

<h2 id="what-needs-improvement">What Needs Improvement?</h2>

<p>Staying focused and getting re-focused. It‚Äôs easier for things to break your
focus during the day ‚Äì a colleague walks in, a friend pings you on Facebook,
an email rolls in. Hell, it can even be internal ‚Äúoh shoot, I need to‚Ä¶‚Äù. When
we do that, we stop mono-tasking. Ultimately, if we keep adding to what we need
to do and keep switching between those things, we never actually get anything
completely done. But if we focus on <em>exactly one thing</em>, maybe, we can. I need
to find more strategies to pull myself back into focus after getting distracted.
Here‚Äôs my current methods, or ‚Äútoolbox‚Äù if you will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start a Pomodoro session</li>
  <li>Put down my cellphone, and read for a fixed amount of time</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-could-make-you-happier">What could make you happier?</h2>

<p>Take the things I want to do and integrate them into the things I have to do. I 
want to be a better developer, so I‚Äôm reading about good software practices and
applying that to my research. I want to be healthier, but I‚Äôm short on time and
motivation. So, I‚Äôm going to swap out beers for tea and coffee this month. Caffeine
is arguably healthier (or at least lower calorie) than beer, health box check. Alcohol
kills my productivity, so I‚Äôll buy back some time too. Let‚Äôs see how this reallocation
of mental energy and physical time fair this month.</p>

<h2 id="strategies-for-next-month">Strategies for Next Month</h2>

<p>This year I‚Äôm taking it upon myself to try as many new strategies and as possible
for self-improvement. On a roughly weekly basis, I‚Äôm employing a new strategy, 
examples so far are‚Ä¶ the pomodoro technique, not using my cell phone for 15 
minutes each day, and bullet journaling. Up next is going to be reading 15 minutes
each day.</p>

<ul>
  <li>No cellphone use for the first 15 minutes of every <em>weekday</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Important when days need to be productive.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Read 15 minutes each day
    <ul>
      <li>Setting aside time to explicitly learn</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pomodoro as much as possible.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="goals-for-next-month">Goals for Next Month</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Break the cellphone rule fewer than 5 times</li>
  <li>Drink fewer than 5 days this month</li>
  <li>Hit the gym at least 3 times</li>
</ul>
