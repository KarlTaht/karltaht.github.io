<h2 id="what-worked-well">What Worked Well?</h2>

<p>Having a clear goal this week was awesome. During Monday - Wednesday, the goal was
really just to work on research. On Monday that didnâ€™t quite happen, because of a 
snowday and the massive 7 day straight grind, but, Tuesday and Wednesday were very
productive. Thursday, I turned my focus to the main goal this week: absolutely 
slaying Lyndseyâ€™s 25th birthday. Sometimes you have to take a step back from craziness
and remember what really matters to you. For me, thatâ€™s easily my wife. And if I
need to choose taking a 3 day weekend + a half day so I can deliver an awesome
once-in-a-lifetime type birthday, hell yeah Iâ€™m gonna do it. I canâ€™t say it helped
my research, but I priorized and succeeding in not only her birthday, but also 
enjoying the weekend myself.</p>

<h2 id="what-needs-improvement">What Needs Improvement?</h2>

<p>There are three areas I want to touch on:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Planning out in detail beyond one day</li>
  <li>Staying accountable</li>
  <li>Pomodoro and focus</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-could-make-you-happier">What could make you happier?</h2>

<p>I really enjoy the time and metrics tracking, but I want to streamline it. While
the time tracking is pretty quick (I do it all with an app), the other metrics
arenâ€™t streamlined yet and take a bit longer to compile. Would be nice to do that
quicker without feeling like Iâ€™m wasting time compiling extraneous informationâ€¦
what can I say, I love data?</p>
