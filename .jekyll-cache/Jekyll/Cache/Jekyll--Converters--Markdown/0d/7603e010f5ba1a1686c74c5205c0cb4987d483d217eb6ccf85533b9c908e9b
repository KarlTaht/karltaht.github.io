<p>Right off the bat, this book captured me with this notion of the “5S philosophy”,
a methodology centered around maintaing high productivity workspaces. The origins 
are rooted in Japanese culture, and intially developed for manufacturing and 
maintenance.</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Seiri</em> (Sort)
    <ul>
      <li>Tasks should be prioritized and simple.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Seiton</em> (Systemization)
    <ul>
      <li>The environment should support the productivity of tasks by through
its orderliness.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Seiso</em> (Shine)
    <ul>
      <li>To maintain an orderly system, we must devote explicit time to cleaning and
sustaining it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Seiketsu</em> (Standardize)
    <ul>
      <li>All practices must be standardized. When things diverge from a standard, systemization
is lost.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Shitsuke</em> (Sustain)
    <ul>
      <li>Self-discipline. All techniques must be continuously applied to achieve
their ultimate goal.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
