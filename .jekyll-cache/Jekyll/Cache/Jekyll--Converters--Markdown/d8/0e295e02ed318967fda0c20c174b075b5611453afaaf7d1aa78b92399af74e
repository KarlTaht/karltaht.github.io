I"_<p>One thing about studying, or really, any kind of working that has limited human
interaction faces one key challenge: staying focused. I think that’s true now 
more than ever with cell phones, social media, email. Everything is trying to 
pull us away from what we’re working on right now. We can make to-do list’s and
stay organized, but eventually we will have to sit down and simply use our mind.</p>

<p>There’s this really interesting chart that demonstrates this notion of “flow”, 
when we are focused on what we are doing and happy, and by extension, most 
productive. In reality, its really hard to achieve this state. Maybe your 
current projectis boring because it’s too easy. Maybe it’s intimidating and 
even starting stresses you out. So, is there a way we can</p>
