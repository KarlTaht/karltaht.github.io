<p>Going to track time and some other hard metrics. We’ll see how many I keep.</p>

<h2 id="what-worked-well">What Worked Well?</h2>

<p>This week was a cluster! I think I realized that fully by Wednesay. As a result, 
I more or less treated like Tuesday/Wednesday as my “working weekend”, and told
myself I’d put in full-time days on the weekend. And I did! Realizing the state
of affairs was good, and while at the time it felt like procastination, it was a
good trade off. My daily to-do list were long, but of mostly shorter tasks. This is
a list of what I had going on this week</p>

<ul>
  <li>Paper re-write for resubmission</li>
  <li>Graduation logistics (actually confusing as hell)</li>
  <li>Scheduling meetings for 3 professors for my proposal</li>
  <li>Preparing for those meetings</li>
  <li>Reading and presenting a paper for arch reading club</li>
  <li>RiTC Workshop website logistics</li>
  <li>RiTC Workshop registration??</li>
</ul>

<p>Seriously, way to much to make any real progress on my main research…until the
weekend. I came in to the lab both Saturday in Sunday and wrote about 1000 lines of code.</p>

<h2 id="what-needs-improvement">What Needs Improvement?</h2>

<p>As easy as it is to justify the craziness, I’d be lying if I didn’t admit some things
slipped through the cracks. For instance, I wasn’t able to secure a sponsorship for traveling
to HPCA, so I wanted to check in with Rajeev before registering. Normally, he is
always in attendance at reading club, which was coincidentally also the last day
of early registration. Unfortunately, he wasn’t able to make it, and I totally 
spaced on following up – oof. Explainable, yes. Acceptable, no. If I do go to HPCA,
I’ll fork over my own money for the registration.</p>

<p>The other major thing that I should touch on momentum. I find between 4-6 hours into
a day, my productivity tanks. Like seriously. Hours 1-2 I’m at like 110%. Hours 3 to 4, 85-90%. Hour 5 boom. 50%. Either that or I take a pause to shift gears and I lose it completely. I think
the best thing to do here is shift</p>

<h2 id="what-could-make-you-happier">What could make you happier?</h2>

<p>I really enjoy the time and metrics tracking, but I want to streamline it. While
the time tracking is pretty quick (I do it all with an app), the other metrics
aren’t streamlined yet and take a bit longer to compile. Would be nice to do that
quicker without feeling like I’m wasting time compiling extraneous information…
what can I say, I love data?</p>

<h2 id="goals-for-next-week">Goals for Next Week</h2>
