I"v<p>I’m a 5th year PhD student studying Computer Science at the University of Utah. 
But I’m also a husband, avid car enthusiast, and general nerd. Welcome!</p>

<h2 id="reality">Reality</h2>

<p>I’m pretty passionate about general self-improvement. Things to put you in a better mindset, things to up your productivity, organization. Thoses types of things. When I find a technique I like, or an article I like, I write about it. But, as we know to well, life isn’t all glamour in good. I write about that stuff too. This page is a public documentation of my strategies, plans, actions, and outcomes.</p>

<h2 id="racing">Racing</h2>

<p>Cars are my one consistent passion through life. I feel like I can’t have my own webpage without dedicating a section to racing. You’ll see occassional posts about track days, projects, and technical analysis here from time to time. I used to write about a blog on DriveTribe, but I think here is a better place.</p>

<h2 id="my-research">My Research</h2>

<p>I’m interested in the intersection of reinforcement learning and computer systems. Every research has certain things that just find really “cool”, no matter how nerdy they may be. For me, reinforcement learning is that thing. The ability that you can simply train an artificial thing to perform a task simply by telling it how “good” it’s currently doing is mind blowing. Yet, most of my experience is in hardware as an EE undergrad and part of the Utah Arch Lab. So my research focuses on asking questions like: how can we teach systems to perform better? How can we build systems which are more adaptive and responsive? Essentially applying that power of learning of computer systems.</p>

<p>Since reinforcement learning–like most modern AI–is computationally heavy, I currently focus on systems level optimization that allows for substantially more freedom than being confined to hardware. Not only that, I simply enjoy writing software. Working in systems is really a treat, as there’s so much freedom to explore the optimization space. We can take cues from end users, software performance metrics, and even tap into the hardware itself.</p>

<h3 id="research-paper-summaries">Research Paper Summaries</h3>

<p>I try to read papers pretty regularly, at least one per-week. I maintained <a href="https://researchdoneright.blogspot.com/">separate blog</a> because of the tagging support, which makes it easy to find papers. I’m currently working to migrate those functionalities
to this page. If you’re looking for a topic and want a quick summary of the paper in words other than the authors, check it out. I try to remain as unbiased as possible in my reviews, but I don’t promise 100% accuracy in replicating the author’s intent. After all, my posts often distort the paper to emphasize elements relevant to my search – dynamic hardware, auto-tuning, and machine learning approaches.</p>
