# Karl Taht's Blog

Welcome to my blog! If you know me from academia or ndustry -- this is the right 
page! If you're interested in what I do outside of work, I write technical blogs 
relating to cars as well, you can find some of my work on [DriveTribe][1] and also on 
my joint-venture site [Data Driven Motorsport][2]. 

## About Me

I’m a 4th year PhD student studying Computer Science at the University of Utah. While I work in the Architecture lab, my main research project is closer to software and systems. My thesis centralizes around program phase detection and both hardware and software performance optimization, all with a machine learning flavor. Through my research, I’ve had the opportunity to intern with Intel Labs twice were I worked on these problems from a hardware engineer’s perspective. In 2019, I'm  hoping to broaden my horizons and look at the same challenges closer to the software side.

### Passion for Organization

Productivity maximization is key for anything. I'm firm believing in organization to promote efficiency, and quite simply enjoy it. I'm looking forward 
to documenting some of my best strategies. This year's going to be a particular challenge as I'll be working from home until May! 

### Research Papers

I try to read papers pretty regularly, at least one per-week. I maintain those in a [separate blog][3] because of the tagging support, which makes it easy to find papers. If you're looking for a topic and want a quick summary of the paper in words other than the authors, check it out. I try to remain as unbiased as possible in my reviews, but I don't promise 100% accuracy in replicating the author's intent. After all, my posts often distort the paper to emphasize elements relevant to my search -- dynamic hardware, auto-tuning, and machine learning approaches.
