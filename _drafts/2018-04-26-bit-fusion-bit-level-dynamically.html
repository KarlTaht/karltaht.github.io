<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Venue: ISCA 2018<br />Authors: Hardik Sharma, Jongse Park, ... , Hadi Esmaeilzadeh<br /><br />Inspired by a previous called <i>STRIPES</i>, this paper proposes a 'reconfigurable architecture' to exploit varied bit-width requirements in neural networks to improve performance and energy efficiency. This accelerator supports both feed-forward (CNN, FC)&nbsp; and recurrent (RNN, LSTM) layers.</div>
